Introduction
Steeze is an off-chain token on the Aura platform, designed to reward creators and community engagement. To ensure security and trust, we‚Äôve implemented a robust system of checks and balances for Steeze transactions, even though it operates off-chain.

This document outlines the key public-facing security practices behind Steeze to reassure users and partners that their interactions are handled securely and transparently.

Security Architecture
‚úÖ Backend-Controlled Interactions
Users never directly interact with smart contracts for Steeze.

All USDC-based purchases and redemptions are handled through a verified backend process.

This reduces the risk of fraudulent or unauthorized blockchain operations.

üîê Access Control & Verification
All Steeze-related actions require secure user authentication.

Validations are performed on wallet addresses and transaction limits.

Only verified wallets are allowed to initiate USDC purchases for Steeze.

üß† Input & Transaction Validation
Input limits are enforced to prevent spam or abuse (min/max USDC thresholds).

Real-time balance checks prevent over-spending or fraudulent claims.

Transactions are monitored against expected behavior patterns.

üì° Event Monitoring
Aura listens for Steeze-related blockchain events (e.g., purchases/redemptions).

Smart contract logs are parsed and checked for expected values.

System alerts are in place for unusual activity or failed attempts.

üìà Balance & Redemption System
Purchased Steeze is credited off-chain and displayed in the user dashboard.

Earned Steeze from activity (like battles or challenges) is eligible for redemption.

Redemption checks ensure only eligible balances are converted back to USDC.
