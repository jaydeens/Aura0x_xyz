# Steeze Security Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented for off-chain Steeze token management in the Aura platform. Since Steeze tokens are managed off-chain, the backend controls all smart contract interactions to ensure security and prevent unauthorized access.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Backend-Controlled Smart Contract Interactions

**Platform Wallet System**
- The platform maintains a secure backend wallet with private key management
- All Steeze purchases and redemptions are executed by the backend, not user wallets
- Users never directly interact with the Steeze smart contract

**Environment Configuration**

### 2. Access Control

**Authentication Requirements**
- All Steeze endpoints require user authentication (`requireAuth` middleware)
- Session validation ensures only authenticated users can access Steeze functions
- User wallet verification prevents unauthorized account access

**Input Validation**
- USDC amounts limited to 1-1000 range to prevent excessive transactions
- Wallet address validation using ethers.js utilities
- Balance verification before any transaction processing

### 3. Transaction Security

**User Balance Validation**
- Real-time USDC balance checking before purchases
- Off-chain Steeze balance verification before redemptions
- Insufficient balance protection with clear error messages

**Transaction Verification**
- Signature validation for all blockchain transactions
- Event parsing from smart contract logs for confirmation
- Transaction hash verification against expected signers

### 4. Event Monitoring System

**Real-Time Event Tracking**
- Continuous monitoring of SteezeBought and SteezeRedeemed events
- Automatic logging of all contract interactions to security database
- Anomaly detection for unusual transaction patterns

**Security Logging Database**
```sql
CREATE TABLE steeze_security_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  event_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  user_address VARCHAR(42) NOT NULL,
  usdc_amount DECIMAL(18, 6) NOT NULL,
  steeze_amount DECIMAL(18, 6) NOT NULL,
  transaction_hash VARCHAR(66) NOT NULL,
  block_number INTEGER,
  detected_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

### 5. API Endpoints Security

**Secure Backend Endpoints**
- `/api/steeze/backend-purchase` - Backend-controlled purchases
- `/api/steeze/backend-redeem` - Backend-controlled redemptions
- All transactions processed through platform wallet, not user wallets

**Rate Limiting & Validation**
- Input sanitization for all user-provided data
- Amount limits (1-1000 USDC for purchases)
- Balance verification before transaction execution

## Security Features

### 1. Off-Chain Balance Management

**Database Integration**
- User Steeze balances stored securely in PostgreSQL
- Purchased vs battle-earned Steeze tracking
- Transaction history with full audit trail

**Balance Updates**
- Atomic database transactions for balance updates
- Rollback protection in case of errors
- Consistent state management across all operations

### 2. Smart Contract Security

**Contract Interaction**
- Backend wallet signs all transactions
- Users receive tokens through backend-managed transfers
- No direct user-to-contract interactions for Steeze operations

**Event Verification**
- Real-time parsing of SteezeBought/SteezeRedeemed events
- Block confirmation requirements
- Transaction receipt validation

### 3. Error Handling & Recovery

**Comprehensive Error Handling**
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Graceful failure handling with user feedback
- Transaction rollback on partial failures

**Security Monitoring**
- Failed transaction attempt logging
- Unusual pattern detection
- Real-time security event alerts

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never expose private keys** in client-side code
2. **Always validate inputs** before processing transactions
3. **Use backend-controlled transactions** for all Steeze operations
4. **Monitor events continuously** for security anomalies
5. **Implement proper error handling** with user feedback

### For Operations

1. **Secure private key storage** with proper encryption
2. **Regular security audits** of transaction logs
3. **Monitor unusual patterns** in user behavior
4. **Backup and recovery procedures** for database
5. **Keep security logs** for compliance and debugging

## Security Contacts

For security-related issues or vulnerabilities:
- Review transaction logs in `steeze_security_logs` table
- Check backend wallet balance and transaction history
- Verify smart contract event monitoring is active
- Escalate to development team for critical issues
