You are a TypeScript developer assistant. I want you to generate a TypeScript integration module for my React + Vite + TanStack Query front-end that allows users to interact with my Solana program using @solana/web3.js. The wallet connection logic already exists, so skip that part. Focus only on building and sending the transactions.

Program details:
- Program ID: Afn4YEKXFismTcsRt4dJkdXZHrreXm42Fqi1HDg99ocV
- RPC endpoint: https://rpc.testnet.carv.io/rpc
- Platform wallet: HiyDHAyvc9TDNm1M8rbAsY7yeyRvJXN5TpBFT6nKZSat
- The program has only one instruction: `deposit_vouch`

Function to generate:
### `depositVouch(recipient: string, mint: string, amount: number, wallet: WalletContextState)`
This function should:
1. Use the connected wallet as `voucher`.
2. Transfer 70% of the amount to the recipient’s token account.
3. Transfer 30% of the amount to the platform wallet’s associated token account.
4. If the platform’s ATA does not exist, create it automatically.
5. Work with standard SPL tokens (assume USDT with 6 decimals).
6. Use @solana/web3.js and @solana/spl-token to:
   - Derive and create ATAs for both recipient and platform if they don’t exist.
   - Construct and send the transaction to the program.
7. Build the transaction instruction using the correct account metas:
   - `voucher`
   - `voucher_token_account`
   - `recipient_token_account`
   - `mint`
   - `platform_wallet_ata`
   - `platform_wallet`
   - `token_program`
   - `associated_token_program`
   - `system_program`
8. Include inline comments describing each step for clarity.
9. Use the correct encoding for 64-bit integers (amounts) in instruction data.
10. Return the transaction signature after confirmation.
11. Handle and log potential errors (e.g., insufficient balance, invalid recipient, missing accounts).

Technical details:
- Use only raw web3.js; do not use Anchor JS.
- Use `TransactionInstruction` and `Transaction` objects directly.
- Assume `wallet` has `publicKey` and `signTransaction` properties from Solana wallet adapter.
- Add helper utilities for:
   - Getting or creating ATAs
   - Converting amount to smallest unit (e.g., `amount * 10 ** 6` for USDT)
- The module should be ready to import and call inside a React component or a TanStack Query mutation.

Expected output:
- A single TypeScript file exporting `depositVouch()`
- Properly typed, fully commented, and compatible with the CARV SVM testnet RPC
