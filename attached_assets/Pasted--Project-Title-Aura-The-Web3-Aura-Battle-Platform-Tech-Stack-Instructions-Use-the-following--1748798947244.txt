🟣 Project Title: Aura — The Web3 Aura Battle Platform
⚙️ Tech Stack Instructions
Use the following technologies:

Frontend: Next.js + TailwindCSS (primary color: purple #8000FF)

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database: PostgreSQL (use Supabase if easier)

Blockchain: Use EVM-compatible chain (Polygon testnet for now), support USDT transfers

AI: Integrate OpenAI’s GPT API to generate daily lessons

Authentication: WalletConnect + Twitter OAuth

Crypto Payments: Use Web3.js or Ethers.js to handle USDT vouching

🧱 Core Features to Build
1. 🧠 Daily Aura Lessons
Allow users to log in via wallet + Twitter.

Generate 3 AI-powered lessons daily using OpenAI API.

After each lesson, the user must tweet a certification message (e.g., “I’m a certified Aura Grinder 💜”) using #AuraCertified.

After successful tweet (via API or manual confirmation), reward X Aura Points.

Track daily streaks and assign roles:

0–4 days: Clout Chaser

5–14 days: Attention Seeker

15–29 days: Grinder

30+: Aura Vader

2. 🧾 Aura Points System
Each lesson completed = 10 Aura Points.

Tweet confirmation is mandatory to earn points.

Store user Aura Points, current streak, and status badge in database.

3. 🪙 Vouching with USDT
Users can vouch for others using USDT (1 USDT = 10 Aura Points).

Split vouch:

60% of USDT goes to the person being vouched for

40% goes to the platform wallet (you)

Vouch multiplier based on vouching user's streak level:

Aura Vader = 2x (20 points)

Grinder = 1.5x (15 points)

Attention Seeker = 1.25x (12.5 points)

Clout Chaser = 1x (10 points)

4. ⚔️ Aura Battles
Users can challenge others to 1v1 Aura Battles.

Each party must stake Aura Points.

Create a battle scheduling UI (available times, countdown).

Voting window = 3–5 hrs. Viewers can vouch to vote.

At the end of the time, winner gets:

Opponent's staked Aura

All vouches (converted to points)

Only Top 3 KOLs on leaderboard are required to accept 1 battle per week or they lose 3% of Aura.
